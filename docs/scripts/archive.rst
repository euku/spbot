It uses CommonsHelper to not leave any information out and CommonSense
to automatically categorise the file. After copying, a NowCommons
template is added to the local wiki's file. It uses a local exclusion
list to skip files with templates not allow on Wikimedia Commons. If no
categories have been found, the file will be tagged on Commons.

only environment.

imageharvest script
-------------------

**Bot for getting multiple images from an external site**

It takes a URL as an argument and finds all images (and other files specified
by the extensions in 'file_formats' that URL is referring to, asking whether to
upload them. If further arguments are given, they are considered to be the text
that is common to the descriptions. BeautifulSoup is needed only in this case.

A second use is to get a number of images that have URLs only differing in
numbers. To do this, use the command line option "-pattern", and give the URL
with the variable part replaced by '$' (if that character occurs in the URL
itself, you will have to change the bot code, my apologies).

wikisourcetext script
---------------------

**This bot applies to Wikisource sites to upload text**

Text is uploaded to pages in Page ns, for a specified Index.
Text to be stored, if the page is not-existing, is preloaded from the file used
to create the Index page, making the upload feature independent from the format
of the file, as long as it is supported by the MW ProofreadPage extension.

As alternative, if '-ocr' option is selected,
OCR tool will be used to get text.
In this case, also already existing pages with quality value 'Not Proofread'
can be treated. '-force' will override existing page in this case.
